  # Add missing designer UPDATE policy and has_accepted_quote helper on customers

  ## Problem
  Designers cannot see assigned/shared projects in the shared section because:
  1. The "Designers can update assigned projects" UPDATE policy is missing —
     designers can read (via is_assigned_designer) but cannot update project
     status, which some flows require.
  2. The has_accepted_quote() helper function is missing, so the customer
     UPDATE policy that prevents edits after quote acceptance cannot work.

  ## Fix
  1. Recreate has_accepted_quote() as a SECURITY DEFINER function.
  2. Replace the customer UPDATE policy with the quote-acceptance-aware version.
  3. Add the designer UPDATE policy for assigned projects.
