-- Fix: rename parameter from `customer_id` to `p_customer_id` to avoid
-- ambiguous column reference with project_shares.customer_id.
-- The old function threw "column reference customer_id is ambiguous" inside
-- the EXISTS subquery, which caused RLS to error out the designer's SELECT
-- on the customers table entirely (policies are OR-ed, one error fails all).

-- Drop both functions with CASCADE (also drops dependent RLS policies)
