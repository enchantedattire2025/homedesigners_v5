/*
  # Restore customers RLS policies and helper functions

  ## Problem
  The customers table has RLS enabled but ZERO policies, so no client can
  INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE any row. Customer registration fails with
  "new row violates row-level security policy for table customers".

  ## Root cause
  The policies and helper functions from earlier migrations are missing from
  the live database — same situation as admin_users.

  ## Fix
  Recreate all customer CRUD policies using auth.uid() ownership checks, plus
  designer/admin read access via recursion-safe SECURITY DEFINER functions.
