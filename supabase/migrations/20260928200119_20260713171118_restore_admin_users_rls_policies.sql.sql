  # Restore admin_users RLS policies and helper functions

  ## Problem
  admin_users has RLS enabled but ZERO policies, so no authenticated
  client can read any row. AdminLogin queries admin_users by user_id and
  always gets null -> "Access denied. This account does not have admin
  privileges."

  ## Root cause
  The helper functions (is_active_admin, is_super_admin) and the admin_users
  RLS policies from earlier migrations are missing from the live database.

  ## Fix
  Recreate the SECURITY DEFINER helper functions and the admin_users RLS
  policies using the recursion-safe pattern: the functions bypass RLS, so
  the SELECT policy can call is_active_admin() without infinite recursion.
